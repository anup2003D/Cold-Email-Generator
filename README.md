## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture

- *CMGmain.py*: Main Streamlit application
- *CMGchain.py*: LangChain integration with GROQ LLM
- *CMGportfolio.py*: Portfolio management with ChromaDB
- *CMGutils.py*: Utility functions for text processing

### Key Features

- *Lazy Loading*: ChromaDB is only initialized when needed
- *Error Handling*: Graceful handling of missing API keys
- *Session State*: Efficient state management in Streamlit
- *Responsive Design*: Works on desktop and mobile

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. *"GROQ_API_KEY environment variable is not set"*
   - Make sure you've added your API key to Streamlit secrets or .env file

2. *ChromaDB initialization errors*
   - The app now uses lazy loading, so ChromaDB only initializes when needed

3. *Import errors*
   - Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all dependencies

### Getting Help

- Check the error messages in the Streamlit interface
- Verify your GROQ API key is valid
- Ensure your portfolio CSV file exists and has the correct format
